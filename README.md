# cooking_app
This is a small practise project

Using JS, HTML and CSS I made a mobile interface app (instagram look alike) that allows you to fetch data from an API (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and then display random recipes 
on the app that you can chose a favourite recipe.
You can also search a recipe and if you click on it you can see information about it.
The project is using Local Storage to store information.
